            Choose colors that compliment your skin tone 
          </h2>
          <hr>
          <br>
          <p>
            When it comes to choosing colors for your clothes and makeup, it’s important to select shades that flatter your skin tone. Different colors can make you look healthier or tired, thinner or heavier, younger or older. So how do you figure out what colors work best for you? By using the color wheel as a guide.
          </p>
          <p>
            The color wheel is divided into three primary colors – red, yellow, and blue – and three secondary colors – green, orange, and purple. These are the six basic hues that can be mixed to create an endless range of other colors. To find your perfect color palette, start by identifying which of the six basic hues looks most like your skin tone.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have a cool complexion with pink undertones, go with blues and purples. If you have a warm complexion with yellow undertones, go with oranges and yellows. And if you have a neutral complexion with no strong undertones, you can wear any color!
          </p>
          <p>
            Once you’ve identified your skin tone, you can start exploring different colors and shades that will compliment your complexion. If you have a cool complexion, try pairing light blue with darker purple. Or, if you have a warm complexion, try pairing peach with golden yellow. And if you have a neutral complexion, mix and match different colors to find what looks best on you!
